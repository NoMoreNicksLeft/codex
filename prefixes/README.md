## Introduction

Long, long ago on an enshittified internet forum, I proposed the idea of a registry for unique id prefixes. I was having a bit of difficulty naming ebook files, as not all notable books have ISBN numbers. Scans of older works, ebooks published by organizations that can't afford to purchase ISBNs or choose not to do so, etc. There exist multiple alternatives to ISBNs, of course, but none are universal and in any case their identification numbers/strings are predictably very similar so who can tell if that's a Library of Congress number or an OCLC number or a Gutenberg Project catalog number? Thus, the idea of having a short, standard prefix that you could prepend to these was born.

This repo will (in part) act as a registry for any such prefixes. Submit pull requests and issues as necessary.

## Guidelines for a unique id prefix proposal:

1. Each should consist of 3-4 ascii/latin alphabetic letters.
2. These are not case sensitive, but in the list please use uppercase for visual purposes.
3. Please include a link to the relevant company, institution, or failing that, a wikipedia link that can help explain your usage.
4. This is free, and unmanaged. There should be no cause for name-squatting. If you believe that a prefix has been used incorrectly, please open an issue.
